implement a proper database migration

n config.go, the Load function appends errors to a slice. This is okay, but for a larger number of checks, a dedicated error aggregation mechanism might be cleaner

 The structToString function in render.go marshals to JSON, which is generally safe if then inserted into a <script> tag with the correct type or properly handled by JavaScript, but direct rendering into HTML without appropriate escaping could be risky. Need more context on this.

Comprehensive Testing: Lack of automated tests is a significant gap.
Enhanced Error Handling & User Feedback: Provide more specific error messages to users.
Security Hardening: More rigorous input validation across all endpoints and a deeper review of authentication/authorization mechanisms.
Database Migrations: Implement a proper database migration system instead of relying on potentially version-controlled .db files or manually applied SQL.
Frontend Polish: Address placeholder content and conduct a thorough accessibility review.
Granular Caching: Implement more fine-grained cache invalidation.
